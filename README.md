# My ERC-20 Token – “Bitcoin”

**Bitcoin (BTC)** is a custom ERC-20 token I developed using **Solidity**.  
It follows the ERC-20 token standard and includes **mint** and **burn** functionalities, enabling the owner to expand or reduce the total token supply.

---

## 🔹 Key Features
- **Total Supply:** defines the number of tokens in existence  
- **Balance:** tracks token ownership per address  
- **Transfer:** allows users to send tokens to others  
- **Approve / TransferFrom:** enables delegated transfers  
- **Mint:** lets the owner generate additional tokens  
- **Burn:** permanently removes tokens from circulation  

---

## 🔹 Deployment Information
Upon deployment, the creator initially receives all tokens.  
Every transaction — from transfers to burns and mints — is executed transparently and automatically by the smart contract.

**Contract Address:** [0xb25d636A0EB6bdda305c31402741A3C5Cf834b63](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb25d636A0EB6bdda305c31402741A3C5Cf834b63)

## 🔹 Overview
This project demonstrates a full understanding of **ERC-20 token mechanics**, including token creation, transfer logic, and owner-controlled supply management.  
It represents a key step in my journey as a **blockchain developer**, combining clean smart contract design with practical token economics.
